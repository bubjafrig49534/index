	<br><br><br><br><h2>Meditation found Baime when he was just six years old.</h2><h5>He didn't learn about it from a friend, a book, or a documentary. <br><br>As he puts it, he didn't <em>find</em> meditation at all. Meditation found <em>him</em>.<br><br><h2><div class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="2s">"I was looking at the sky when something happened," he explains.</h2></div>

	<h2><br><div class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="2s"><h5>"I had this dramatic experience of time stopping, of falling in contact with everything. I found that I could make that feeling happen if I did certain things with my mind. Like the way I focussed on the sky, or if I walked at a certain pace."<br></h5></div>
	<div class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="2s"><h5>Baime asked his parents if he could formally study mindfulness in the Buddhist tradition at around the age of twelve. They were supportive, but his options were limited by geography: the suburbs of Pittsburgh in the mid-1960s weren't exactly teeming with Buddhists. Baime's family eventually found two locals willing to mentor their son, and he began his somewhat-formal exploration of mindfulness by age fourteen.</h5></div><div class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="2s"><h2>It's totally wrong.</h2></div> <div class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="2s"><h5>Messages and ideas don't really spread like viruses. Ideas spread more like independent objects in an ecosystem. For life to survive in an ecosystem, the environment has to be <em>just right</em>. The same thing is true for ideas. Meditation probably wouldn't have caught on in America in the year 1901. The requisite cultural forces just weren't there. <br></div><div class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="2s"><h5>To learn more about how meditation went from a sacred religious act to a mainstream American activity, I spoke to lifelong devotee and advocate, <strong>Dr. Michael Baime</strong>.</h5><br></div>
