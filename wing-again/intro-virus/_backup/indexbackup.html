<h2>People have been saying messages and ideas spead like viruses for more than sixty years.</h2>
<h5>H.G. Landau and Anatol Raport were the first to compare the spread of information to the spread of diseases, in the 15th edition of the  <em>Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics</em> in 1953. They used equations to show how advanced  models that help predict the spread of disease could also be applied to the spread of information.</h5>
<h5>Nearly a decade later, public health scholar Vaun Newill and scentist William Goffman  published a paper <em> </em>expanding on this concept. They wrote:</h5>
<div class ="blockquote">
  <span class="highlight">
    People are susceptible to certain ideas and resistant to others. Once an individual is infected with an idea they may in turn, after some period of time, transmit it to others.</span>
</div>

<h5>And it makes sense, right? 
  
  You tell a friend about a cool new donut shop,  they tell their friends, who then tell their friends. Pretty soon the  shop has a line wrapping around the block every Saturday morning. The idea (<em>that donut shop is good</em>) spreads from person-to-person, just like the chicken pox virus  spreads from person-to-person, until it infects an entire kindergarten class.</h5>

<h5>It seems obvious to us now, sixty years later. The word <em>meme</em> and the phrase <em>going viral</em> are parts of our everyday discourse. But it's worth stepping back and examining how we got here. Let's start with those real-world viruses.</h5>
<div class ="blockquote">
  <span class="highlight">
   You only need two conditions for a virus to spread:</span>

        <h5>Let's take Darwin and his theory of evolution as an example of an idea that may have spread like a virus. We can say that Darwin was host to the <strong>infective</strong> (his theory of evolution). When he published <em>The Origin of the Species </em>in 1859<em>, </em>he was spreading the infective to other scientists. The scientists who saw the value of his theory and incorporated it into their worldview were <strong>susceptibles</strong>. The Catholic church failed to accept evolution for decades. Since they were initially immune to Darwin's idea,  they can be considered <strong>removed</strong>.</h5></td>

<h2>Who cares if ideas spread like viruses or not?</h2>
    <h5>The reason we should pay attention to this analogy is simple. Everyone wants to figure out how to get their big idea to catch on. Once you establish that ideas spread from person-to-person, you can use models from epidemiology to predict how your idea might spread through culture.<br><br>
      We'll get into this more later, but for let's talk about AIDS. </h5>
    <h5> This is a model of an epidemic made using  software. It shows how the AIDS virus spreads from person-to-person, based on pre-programmed parameters. The useful thing about this model is that you can change the assumptions, to see how the virus would spread based on variables like condom use, HIV testing, and  length of an average relationship. </h5>

      <td><h5>In the <em>Media Virus</em> (1994), author Douglas Rushkoff insists that "this term is not being used as a metaphor. These media events are not like viruses. They <strong>are</strong> viruses. They spread rapidly if they provoke our interest, and their success is dependent on the particular strengths and weaknesses of the host organism, popular culture. The virus code mixes and competes for control with the cellâ€™s own genes, and, if victorious, it permanently alters the way the cell functions and reproduces.&quot;</h5></td>

Ideas not only replicate easily and well, they get more powerful and more valuable as you deliver them to more people.&quot;</h5></td>

<h2>But do ideas really spread like viruses?</h2>
<h5><em>Going viral </em>is only one way to explain the diffusion of messages and ideas. It's a model, an &quot;idealization of the real situation in which the complex process is reduced to its essential properties&quot; (source: Generalization of epidemic theory). <br><br>Is virality the best model? If it is, how does knowing that  help us create ideas that catch on?<br><br>
The short answer: <strong>I don't know</strong>. That's why I created this website. To build it, I talked to people from different disciplines to find out how they think ideas spread in their respective industries. <br><br>I learned something unexpected in each interview, and I think you will, too.<br><br></h5><h2>So let's dive in.</h2>
