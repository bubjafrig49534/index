<h2>Do messages and ideas really &quot;go viral&quot;?</h2>
<h5>Thanks to internet services like YouTube and Twitter, the analogy of content spreading like a virus has gone, well,<strong> viral. </strong>But is that really how stuff spreads?</h5>
<h5>That's what this project sets out to investigate. </h5>
<h5>But first, let's talk about viruses. (The kind that make you sick.) </h5>
<h5>Viruses spread by person-to-person contact. Little Timmy coughs into his hand, then lends his pencil to little Sammy, and before you know it: Mrs. Maybray's entire kindergarten class is home sick  the rest of the week.</h5>
<h5>Now let's use a <strong>model</strong> to explore how a virus spreads in a population. Models are interactive simulations we can use to explore real-world concepts—like how a virus spreads through a kindergarten class—without actually getting anyone sick.</h5>
<h5>Here's how this model works. There are three types of people:</h5>
<div class="img-real">

	</div>
<p>
<h5>Susceptible people can get sick if they're exposed to someone else who sick. This doesn't <em>guarantee</em> they'll get sick, just that there's a <em>chance</em> they will. This model shows how a virus can spread in a population. </h5>
<h5>Click on any of the squares to make someone sick. Once you run the model once, you can change how it runs  by adjusting the settings on the right-hand side. </h5>
<h5>Math! Emojis! Sickness! Fun!</h5>

  <br>
  Now that we have a  basic understanding of how viruses spread, we're ready to talk about how how the viral analogy got applied to the world of messages, ideas, and marketing.</h5>
<h2>It all started more than sixty years ago.</h2>
   <h5>H.G. Landau and Anatol Raport were the first to compare the spread of information to the spread of diseases, in the 15th edition of the  <em>Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics</em> in 1953.</h5>
<h5>Nearly a decade later, public health scholar Vaun Newill and scentist William Goffman  published a paper in the journal<em> Science, </em>in which they argued that models of disease diffusion could be extended to describe other situations, such as the spread of ideas in a culture. They wrote:</h5>
<div class ="blockquote">
  <span class="highlight">
    People are susceptible to certain ideas and resistant to others. Once an individual is infected with an idea they may in turn, after some period of time, transmit it to others.</span>
</div>
    <h2><br>The internet renewed interest in this idea.</h2>
    <h5>Many popular books were written about <em>viral marketing </em>and <em>viral media </em>in the 1990s and early 2000s.</h5>
    <table width="100%" border="0" background="assets/rushkoff.png">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><h5>In the <em>Media Virus</em> (1994), author Douglas Rushkoff insisted that "this term is not being used as a metaphor. These media events are not like viruses. They <strong>are</strong> viruses. They spread rapidly if they provoke our interest, and their success is dependent on the particular strengths and weaknesses of the host organism, popular culture. The virus code mixes and competes for control with the cell’s own genes, and, if victorious, it permanently alters the way the cell functions and reproduces.&quot;</h5></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
<table width="100%" border="0" background="assets/gladwell.png">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
<h5> In his 2007 book <em>The Tipping Point</em>, Malcolm Gladwell said the "best way to understand the emergence of fashion trends, the ebb and flow of crime waves, or the rise of teenage smoking, or any number of the other mysterious changes that mark everyday life is to think of them as epidemics.</h5>
<h5>&quot;<strong>Ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread just like viruses do.</strong>"</h5></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>

<table width="100%" border="0" background="assets/godin.png">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><h5>And in <em>Unleashing the Ideavirus</em> (2000), Seth Godin breaks down the analogy even further, saying that <strong>sneezers</strong> "infect the masses" with contagious ideas that spread far and wide, passing from person-to-person.<br><br>"The longer people are sneezing about your idea,&quot; Seth writes, &quot;the more people they infect. Ideas not only replicate easily and well, they get more powerful and more valuable as you deliver them to more people.&quot;</h5></td>
    </tr>

	<h2>And that's just a sample.</h2> <h5>Check out many books contained the phrase <em>viral marketing</em> by 2008. Sure, the count reaches just over 0.000000300% in 2008. But look at that growth rate!</h5>

  <h2>Let's explore this idea with another example.</h2>
  <h5>Now that we're on the same page about real can-make-you-sick viruses, let's return to the world of <strong>media</strong> and <strong>marketing</strong>. The typical story goes something like this.</h5>
  <h5>Remarkable products spread from word-of-mouth You tell a friend about a cool new donut shop,  they tell their friends, who then tell their friends. </h5>
<h5>Pretty soon the shop has a line wrapping around the block every Saturday morning. The idea (<em>that donut shop is good</em>) spreads from person-to-person, just like the chicken pox virus  spreads from person-to-person, until it infects an entire kindergarten class.</h5>

<h5>Now let's explore this example with a model.</h5>
<h5>Here it is.</h5>

<h2>Messages and ideas don't really spread like viruses.</h2>
<p>
<h5>You should—if you have an idea you want to spread to other people, that is.</h5>
<h5>When proponents of the viral diffusion model posit that ideas spread like viruses, they’re using what has the markings of an empirical scientific theory to validate their belief that word-of-mouth diffusion is the future of marketing. But in reality, their work borrows the prestige of a biological process to give credibility and a cohesive narrative to a limited selection of handpicked anecdotes and case studies that happen to validate their proposition. <br><br>
      We'll get into this more later. This  essay will  use  <strong>interactive models </strong>to help me tell my story. Models (also known as simulations) help sociologists  use quantitative methods to examine complex social phenomena, like the spread of an idea in a population.</h5>
    <h5>Below is a simple model of how an epidemic might spread through a population. The model shows how the AIDS virus spreads from person-to-person, based on pre-programmed parameters. The useful thing about this model is that you can change the assumptions to see how the virus would spread based on variables like condom use, HIV testing, and length of an average relationship. </h5>

    <h5>We'll talk about models more later. For now, let's learn more about the figures who say ideas spread like viruses.</h5><br><br>

<h2>But do ideas really spread like viruses?</h2>
<h5><em>Going viral </em>is only one way to explain the diffusion of messages and ideas. It's a model, an &quot;idealization of the real situation in which the complex process is reduced to its essential properties&quot; <em>(source: Generalization of epidemic theory). <br>
</em><br>
This essay introduces a new analogy we can use to understand the spread of ideas in a culture. It emerged from conversations I had for this project with people from various disciplines—including linguistics, fashion design, health and wellness, entrepreneurship, academia, political science, graphic design, and more. </h5>
