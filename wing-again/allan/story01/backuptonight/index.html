<h2>Am I supposed to be seeing this?</h2>
<h5>In 2014, German artist Katharina Grosse came to Philadelphia to install a series of murals along the Northeast regional rail corridor between 30th Street Station and the North Philadelphia Station. The project was called <em>psychylustro</em>.<br><br><div class="img-real"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/knightfoundation/14437470736/in/photolist-nZMP4f-nKmDtP-nKmDpv-nKkS7s-nxkjYz-nxkk1i-njxCp3"><img src="assets/mural01.jpg" alt="psychylustro mural"></a></div><h5>The Mural Arts Program <a href="https://www.muralarts.org/artworks/psychylustro/">said</a> the installation was created to:</h5> <div class ="blockquote"><span class="highlight">"change the way thousands of people think about getting from point A to point B [as] train riders traveling in and out of Philadelphia catch glimpses of this monumental creation, which unfolds in a series of seven bright, bold passages that explore scale, perspective and the passage of time."</span></div>
<br><h5>Although the murals are visible from some streets and pedestrian bridges, they're best viewed by train. <br><br>And while it's possible to see the murals at any time of day, they're best experienced on the way home from a long day of work, when you're most likely to drift in and out of the moment. As your thoughts about work, life, and the meaning of life move in and out of focus, Grosse's paintings on the sides of abandoned buildings and graffiti-covered walls and bridges drift in and out of your conscious visual awareness, too.
<br>

   <h2>Like, really. Is that supposed to be there?</h2>
   <h5>Like Grosse's psychylustro murals, Allan Espiritu's work aims to change your relationships with the everyday world through mind-bending visual design.<br><br>That's why the Mural Arts Program chose his firm, <a href="http://gdloft.com/portfolio/mural-arts-psychylustro/">GDLOFT</a>, to create the promotional campaign for Grosse's installation. The campaign included printed postcards, bus-stop advertisements, posters, and more.<br><br>Espiritu's design for the exhibition featured quotations from Grosse, arranged as ethereal layers of color and typography.</h5> 
     <br><div class ="blockquote"><span class="highlight">"I represented the artist’s approach to her work, which makes no distinction between background and foreground," Espiritu says. "In her work, everything is a canvas." </span></div><br><br><br>
     <h2>He also made those quotations difficult to read.</h2> 
     <div class="img-real"> <a href="http://gdloft.com/portfolio/mural-arts-psychylustro"><img src="assets/work01.jpg"></a></div>
	<h5>Relax. There's a good reason for it. Much like Grosse herself, Espiritu uses his work to change people's perceptions about the world around them.<br><br>"I like the idea of confusion," Espiritu says. "Confusing the viewer. The words [on the postcard above] go in and out. You'll stay with this because you'll wonder, was that a mistake? Am I supposed to read that?"</h5><br><br>
      <div class="img-real"> <img src="assets/line.png"></div><br>
<h2><h69 id="myH69">Like Espiritu's design for psychylustro, parts of this story are designed to be difficult to read.</h69></h2> 
	<h5>But you can fix that:

		 <div class="img-real"> <img src="assets/line.png"></div><br><h2>Espiritu's postcards for Grosse's exhibition are the visual incarnation of Loewenstein's <em>gap theory of curiosity.</em></h2>
	<table width="100%" border="0" background="assets/economist.png">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><h5>George Loewenstein is a behavioral economist and professor at Carnegie Mellon University. His theory states that when we recognize a gap in our curiosity, it <strong>captures our attention and demands to be fulfilled</strong>. <br><br>He thought about the pursuit of curiosity in biological terms. Information gaps “produce the feeling of deprivation. The curious individual is then motivated to obtain the missing information to reduce the feeling of deprivation.” When our curiosity is satiated, the result is a feeling of pleasure. The pursuit of knowledge enhances “the pleasure subsequently derived from obtaining [the] information.”<br><br>Espiritu concurs: "When you make someone work for something, you can make them more connected to it," he told me.<br><br></h5></td></tr>
  </tbody>	</table>
	<h2>Espiritu's interpretation of psychylustro brings Loewenstein's gap theory to the humble postcard.</h2>
	
		<h5>Everyone knows what the job of the typical postcard is. Most postcards feature some sort of <strong>sentiment</strong> (say, a scenic photograph) on the front, and <strong>information</strong> on the back (say, a handwritten note or details about an upcoming event). The postcard is a medium with such strong conventions, it's nearly impossible to imagine it being anything else.<br><br>But that didn't stop Espiritu.</h5>
	
<br><br>	<div class="img-real"> <img src="assets/work02.jpg"></div><br><br>

	<h5>"This postcard, and the way you interact with it, is novel," Espiritu explains. "With a typical postcard, you're supposed to get it and throw it away. But I'm not really into that. With this project, the experience of getting a postcard isn't just <em>oh, I read it, now I'll throw it away</em>. This postcard demands to be processed."<br></h5>
 <h5><h55>It’s through these little moments of confusion that Espiritu hopes his ideas will resonate with his audience and cause them to take fewer things about their visual landscape for granted. <br><br>"My goal is to disrupt the way you interact with graphic media," Espiritu says. "I'm interested in giving people a different experience. Because we're all doing the same thing every day. We're kind of like zombies. And I hate to be bored. So how can I disrupt boredom of someone's experience? <strong>Even if it's just a stupid little thing, like a postcard.</strong> If you're distracted, then I've broken your everyday routine, and I've done my job. Maybe the next effect is you start to question everday things more."</h55><div class="buttont">

	<h2><br>Like traditional advertising and graphic design, Espiritu's work is designed to draw attention to his clients' work.</h2>
	 	
	<h5>But if one were to judge Espiritu’s work according to the viral spread of ideas and messages, it might not score highly.<br><br> The kind of awareness he wants to achieve is in the mind of just one person. In fact, the design of his postcard might make it <em>more</em> difficult to share with others, since its legibility was intentionally obfuscated. <h66 id="myH66"><br><br>The viral analogy is limited to the examination of content that's transmitted from person-to-person, which omits a whole host of alternate possibilities, like creator-to-person and media-to-person. And while the goal of Espiritu's project was to increase awareness of Grosse’s installation, he had a secondary objective: to change the viewer's perception of everyday items, beyond just one mural or postcard.</h66></h5><h5><button onclick="myFunction2()">Change color</button></h5>
	 	<script>
function myFunction2() {
	document.getElementById("myH66").style.color = "black";}
</script><h5><strong>A key benefit of an ecosystem approach to the spread of messages and ideas</strong> is that it offers a new way of examining the spread of ideas from the perspective of an individual, a population, or the ecosystem at-large. <br><br>When examined through the lens of an ecosystem, we can explore the spread of messages and ideas from either a broad or narrow perspective, as appropriate to the research question at hand. While the viral analogy is limited to person-to-person contact, the ecosystem model permits us to examine creative works from the viewpoint of the individual, not just as a binary population of those who have been exposed to the virus, and those who have not.</h5>
	 <h2><br>The ecosystem model isn't perfect.</h2><h5>But it allows us look at the ways ideas spread in a more realistic and nuanced way.</h5>
