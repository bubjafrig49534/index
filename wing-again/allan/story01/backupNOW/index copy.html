<h2>Am I supposed to be seeing this?</h2>
<h5>In 2014, German artist Katharina Grosse came to Philadelphia to install a series of murals along the Northeast regional rail corridor between 30th Street Station and the North Philadelphia Station. The project was called <em>psychylustro</em>.<br><br><div class="img-real"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/knightfoundation/14437470736/in/photolist-nZMP4f-nKmDtP-nKmDpv-nKkS7s-nxkjYz-nxkk1i-njxCp3"><img src="assets/mural01.jpg" alt="psychylustro mural"></a></div><h5>The Mural Arts Program <a href="https://www.muralarts.org/artworks/psychylustro/">said</a> the goal of the installation was to:</h5> <div class ="blockquote"><span class="highlight">"change the way thousands of people think about getting from point A to point B [as] train riders traveling in and out of Philadelphia catch glimpses of this monumental creation, which unfolds in a series of seven bright, bold passages that explore scale, perspective and the passage of time."</span></div>
<br><h5>Although the murals are visible from some streets and pedestrian bridges, they're meant to be experienced by train. <br><br>And while it's possible to see them from <em>any</em> train that passes by, they're best viewed on the way home after a long day of work—when you're most likely to drift in and out of the moment. As your thoughts about the day move in and out of focus, Grosse's paintings on the sides of abandoned buildings and graffiti-covered walls and bridges enter and leave your sphere of visual awareness, too.

   <h2>Is that supposed to be there?</h2>
   <h5>Like Grosse's psychylustro murals, Allan Espiritu's work aims to change your relationship to your everyday world through mind-bending visual design.<br><br>That's why the Mural Arts Program chose his firm, <a href="http://gdloft.com/portfolio/mural-arts-psychylustro/">GDLOFT</a>, to create the promotional campaign for Grosse's installation. The campaign included printed postcards, bus-stop advertisements, posters, and more.<br><br>Espiritu's design for the exhibition featured quotations from Grosse, arranged as intricate layers of typography.</h5> <br><div class ="blockquote"><span class="highlight">"I represented the artist’s approach to her work, which makes no distinction between background and foreground," Espiritu says. "Everything is a canvas." </span></div><br><br><br><h2>The campaign was also designed to be difficult to read.</h2> <div class="img-real"> <a href="http://gdloft.com/portfolio/mural-arts-psychylustro"><img src="assets/work01.jpg"></a></div><h5>And for a good reason.</h5><h99>
      "I like the idea of confusion," Espiritu says. "Confusing the viewer. The words [on the postcard above] go in and out. You'll stay with this because you'll wonder, was that a mistake? Am I supposed to read that?"<br><br></h99>

	<h5>...can be described by the gap theory of curiosity, established by behavioral economist George Loewenstein in 1994. His theory states that when we recognize a gap in our curiosity, it captures our attention and the gap demands to be fulfilled. He compares the pursuit of curiosity in biological terms, saying that information gaps “produce the feeling of deprivation […] The curious individual is motivated to obtain the missing information to reduce or eliminate the feeling of deprivation.” When our curiosity is satiated, the result is a feeling of pleasure. The very process of the pursuit of knowledge enhances “the pleasure subsequently derived from obtaining [the] information.”
