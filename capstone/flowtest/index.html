<h3>And I'm not interested in the disposability of graphic design. I've never been. I think that's always where it's been a problem for me as a graphic designer, that I make disposable things. I hate that the thing that I make is disposable. <br><br>So I try to resist that. [the tension] is a challenge and it's my perspective on it. i love graphic design but i hate being a graphic designer. that's definitely developed through my grad school interests, and just it was always this kind of tension to be wanting to be a fine artist and being in graphic design, which isn't anything like graphic design. it's related to fine art, but fine art is treasured while graphic design isn't. and that's where it's always been kind of a problem. it's disposable. so the perspective that i always try to bring into anything is how do you keep people connected to the thing. and sometimes it's related to ideas of sustainability, like i always had a problem that graphic design added junk to the world. so if you made work that people want to keep and are interested in, or it was a project that would be developed over time, and people would find things through time in your work, that people want to stay with it.
